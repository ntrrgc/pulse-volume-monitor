PulseAudio console volume monitor
=================================

This is a text-based PulseAudio volume monitor. 

At startup, it prints a new line with the current system volume as a percentage. Every time the system volume is changed, a new line is printed with the new value.

This is intended to be used in scripts like those for desktop widgets such as [lemonbar](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar) and [conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky). This utility provides accurate readings without needing to resort to polling.

## Building

You can use the typical building procedure for CMake projects:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake <path to project>
    make

## Example usage

Execute the command in the terminal and change your system volume using hotkeys, your desktop controls or pavucontrol.

    $ ./pulse_volume_monitor --desired-sink analog
    57.341%
    57.9636%
    57.9636%
    59.1217%
    59.8343%
    60.6354%
    61.0794%

## Usage

    USAGE: 

       ./pulse_volume_monitor  [-s <name>] [-j] [-v] [--] [--version] [-h]


    Where: 

       -s <name>,  --desired-sink <name>
         Insert here part of the name of an audio card (as seen in pavucontrol)
         and it will be selected instead of just picking the first available.

       -j,  --json
         Use detailed JSON output.

       -v,  --verbose
         Shows more information than really necessary.

       --,  --ignore_rest
         Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.

       --version
         Displays version information and exits.

       -h,  --help
         Displays usage information and exits.


       Reports the current volume of a PulseAudio sink, in an asynchronous way
       (without polling)
